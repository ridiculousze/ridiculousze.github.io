I am broadly interested in how human cognitive diversity co-evolved with our unique language capabilities and cultural systems (i.e., culture evolutionary processes). Traditional cognitive neuroscience, operating from a biologically conservative standpoint, often overlooks these crucial evolutionary components. By examining the interplay between specialized language systems and cultural evolutionary processes, I seek to better understand the full spectrum of human cognitive variation.

Below are some topics/projects that I have been working on/am interested (all focused on a key cognitive component in human mind: long-term semantic memory):

**The Evolution of Semantic Space Across Cultures and Time**
Semantic knowledge - our mental representation of concepts - plays a crucial role in cultural evolution. Semantics shapes how cultures develop and transmit information, and cultural processes in turn influence how we mentally represent concepts. By combining neurocognitive frameworks of semantic representation with cross-cultural research, I study how semantic systems vary across languages and cultures, and how they adapt to ecological and cultural changes.

**How Language Experience Shape Abstract Cognition**
Language can make labels, create relations, and convey complex cultural information. This linguistic capacity possibly shapes abstract cognition through multiple mechanisms: categorization, relation building, and cultural transmission. I want to study cross-cultural cognitive phenotype patterns, and how they link to/or shaped by specific language experience.

**How Semantic Processing Regulate Cultural Evolutionary Processes**
Information transmission forms the foundation of cumulative cultural evolution, with its effectiveness and persistence heavily influenced by both semantic representations and cognitive filtering mechanisms. These dual factors - how information is mentally represented and processed - play crucial roles in shaping cultural evolution patterns. A prime example is the widespread preference for certain narrative structures across different cultures, which further facilitate the transmission of culture belief and values. I want to study what are the fundamental semantic and cognitive constraints in such processes.
