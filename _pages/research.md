I am broadly interested in how human cognitive diversity co-evolved with our unique language capabilities and cultural systems (i.e., culture evolutionary processes). Traditional cognitive neuroscience, operating from a biologically conservative standpoint, often overlooks these crucial evolutionary components. By examining the interplay between specialized language systems and cultural evolutionary processes, I seek to better understand the full spectrum of human cognitive variation.

Below are some topics/projects that I am interested/have been working on:

**The Evolution of Knowledge Systems Across Cultures and Time**
