Hello! I am **Ze Fu (付泽)** — a cognitive scientist interested in how humans build and update internal models of the world. I study how **semantic knowledge**, as a core component of human cognition, varies across **languages, cultures, and ecological environments**, and how these variations emerge through cultural and biological evolution.

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher at Institut Jean Nicod, École Normale Supérieure – PSL (Paris)**, working with **Prof. Nicolas Baumard**. Before this, I completed my Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience at **Beijing Normal University**, advised by **Prof. Yanchao Bi**. I also spent time at UC Berkeley as a visiting student.

My work integrates methods from  
**cognitive neuroscience · cultural evolution · human behavioral ecology · large-scale text and language models · neuro-semantic modeling**  
to understand the universal and adaptive structures of meaning representation.

Here is my latest **[CV](/files/fuze_cv.pdf)**.

## Research Overview
My research asks a central question:  
**How does the human mind organize meaning, and how does this organization adapt to cultural and ecological pressures?**

To address this, I combine:

- cross-linguistic semantic modeling (53+ languages)  
- historical corpora and pathogen/climate databases (100+ years)  
- fMRI data from multilingual participant samples  
- computational semantics (embeddings, graph models, LLM-based analysis)  
- cross-cultural behavioral data  

These integrative approaches allow me to map both **universal neurocognitive principles** and **systematic cross-cultural variations** in semantic representation.

## 🌍 Universal structures of meaning across languages
Recent advances in language models allow us to compare semantic structures across hundreds of languages. However, methodological differences often lead to inconsistent conclusions about what is “universal” versus “culture-specific.”

Using:

- 53 languages’ embeddings  
- 253 participants’ semantic ratings across 8 languages  
- 86 participants’ fMRI responses across 45 languages  

we show that:

- **13 neurocognitive semantic dimensions** form a universal backbone of meaning  
- **climate** systematically shapes cross-language semantic variations

## 🦠 How pathogens shape semantic space across cultures and history
A core component of semantic representation is the **sensorimotor** information embedded in words. But how does this dimension evolve?

Across:

- 43 countries  
- 100+ years of historical text  
- multiple pathogen databases  

we find that **higher pathogen severity → stronger sensorimotor semantic dimensions** in the collective lexical space. These shifts persist after controlling for wealth and cultural tightness, and reflect a deeper cognitive adaptation during cultural evolution.

## 🧠 How semantic relations are encoded in the brain
Languages encode a rich set of structural relations (co-occurrence, shared neighbors, graph paths). How are these abstract relations reflected in the brain?

Using graph-based semantic models + fMRI, we find:

- ATL encodes **graph-common-neighbor** relations  
- IFG & pMTG encode **graph-shortest-path** relations  
- Visual scene-selective cortex encodes similar structural relations in image-based semantic graphs  

Highlighting that **neural semantic systems are tuned to the statistical structure of information**.

## Outside academia
I enjoy watching films, running, reading fiction and essays, and wandering around cities with friends.  
I am fascinated by **stories** in all their forms — one of humanity’s most beautiful inventions.
