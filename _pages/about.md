Hello! I am Ze Fu (付 泽). I am curious about how people make sense of the world using their internal mental models - the knowledge, beliefs and cultural products obtained through both biological and cultural evolution processes. To explore this, I combine insights and methods from different research fields like cognitive neuroscience, culture evolution, and behavioral ecology. 

I am a PhD student in Cognitive Neuroscience working with [Dr. Yanchao Bi](https://bilab.bnu.edu.cn/people.html) at Beijing Normal University. My research compares how people represent meaning across different languages and historical periods, with a focus on how ecological and cultural factors shape these representations. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Psychology at Central China Normal University, where I developed my interest in Cognitive Science. Here is my [CV]. 

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, reading books, running, and walking with friends. I'm fascinated by stories in all their forms - they're one of humanity's most beautiful inventions!

### What is the universal semantic structure in languages across the globe?
#### Semantic representation; Culture evolution; Cross-language alignment
Recent advances in language models allow us to compare word meaning alignment across a large number of languages (Youn et al., 2016; Thompson et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2023) to answer the classic "universal vs culture-specific" debate, while different semantic representation assupmtions and methodologies may result different conclusions. Combined with evidences from mulptile approaches (53 languages' word embedding computation with model comparisons; 253 subjects, 8 languages' rating validation; 86 subjects, 45 languages' fMRI activity validation), we proposed a framework to understand cross-language meaning representation: the universal constrains rise from the intrinsic way in which the human brain represents semantic knowledge (13-neurocognitive salient dimensions) and variations from nature environments (e.g., climate).

### How sensorimotor knowledge evolve in history text?
#### Semantic representation; Culture evolution; Historical psychology
A salient dimension in human semantic space is sensorimotor information carried by words/concepts. From an embodiment view, such information is highly grounded in human interaction with environments. Using a series large-scale text analyses across space (over 43 countries) and space (over the past 100 years), we found that the intensity of sensorimotor information in the collective semantic space significantly modulated by the intensity of infectious diseases. Such a cognitive related change could potentially serve as a potential mechanism for cultural changes.

### How language-derived semantic relations represented in the brain?
#### Semantic representation; Human structural learning; 
Human language system is good at extracting abstract relations from natural language expression. We considered different relations computed from Google n-gram corpus that language might be sensitive to from graph learning literature (first-order co-occurrence, sencondary common neighbor relations, and shortest path) and found that different subsystems in the language network are sensitive to different relations: anterior temporal lobe (capturing graph-common-neighbors), inferior frontal gyrus, and posterior middle/inferior temporal gyrus (capturing graph-shortest-path). Similar structural relations computed from visual scene database (VisualGeonme) were found in human scene area, highlighting the information type-specific and statistical property specific manner of semantic representations in the human brain.
