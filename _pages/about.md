Hello! I am **Ze Fu (付泽)**. I study how humans represent meaning, and how semantic knowledge varies across **languages, cultures, and ecological environments**. My work combines approaches from **cognitive neuroscience**, **cultural evolution**, and **large-scale language analysis** to understand both the **universal structure** of semantic representations and their **adaptive variations** across time and space.

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher at Institut Jean Nicod, École Normale Supérieure – PSL (Paris)**, working with **Prof. Nicolas Baumard**. I received my Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience from **Beijing Normal University** (advisor: **Prof. Yanchao Bi**), and previously studied at **UC Berkeley** as a visiting student.  
Here is my **[CV](/files/fuze_cv.pdf)**.

Outside work, I enjoy films, books, running, and long walks with friends. I like all forms of stories—one of the most remarkable human inventions.

# Research Focus
My research aims to understand:

**How does the human mind structure meaning, and how does this structure adapt to cultural and ecological contexts?**

To address this question, I draw on:

- cross-linguistic semantic modeling (50+ languages)  
- historical corpus analyses (100+ years)  
- fMRI studies of semantic representation  
- cultural and ecological datasets (e.g., climate, pathogens, norms)  
- computational models (embeddings, graph models, LLM-based analysis)

This integrative approach allows me to examine both **shared neurocognitive constraints** and **systematic cross-cultural/historical variation** in semantic representation.

# Recent Work
Below are some recent projects that reflect this broader direction.

## Universal semantic structure across languages
How similar are semantic structures across human languages?  
Using:

- word embeddings from 53 languages  
- semantic ratings from 253 speakers across 8 languages  
- fMRI data covering 45 languages  

we identify:

- **13 universal neurocognitive semantic dimensions**  
- ecological factors (e.g., **climate**) that shape cross-language variability

## Pathogens and long-term shifts in semantic space
We tested whether infectious disease levels shape how societies use and organize meaning.  
Across:

- 43 countries (cross-cultural)  
- 100+ years (historical corpora)  
- multiple pathogen databases  

we find that **higher pathogen severity is consistently associated with stronger sensorimotor semantic dimensions**.  
This pattern remains after controlling for wealth, cultural tightness, and autoregressive structure.

## Neural representations of language-derived relations
Different kinds of semantic relations are embedded in linguistic data.  
Using graph-based measures and fMRI, we show:

- ATL encodes **graph common-neighbor** relations  
- IFG and pMTG encode **graph shortest-path** relations  
- similar structural relations appear in the scene-selective cortex for visual-concept graphs
