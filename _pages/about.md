I am Ze Fu (付泽).I am curious about how people make sense of the world using their internal mental models - the knowledge, beliefs and cultural products obtained through both biological and cultural evolution processes. To explore this, I combine insights and methods from different research fields like cognitive neuroscience, cultural evolution, and human behavioral ecology.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Institut Jean Nicod, École Normale Supérieure – PSL (Paris), working with [Nicolas Baumard](https://nicolasbaumards.org/). I completed my Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience at Beijing Normal University, advised by [Yanchao Bi](https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/bilab/). Here is my [CV](/files/fuze_cv.pdf).

Outside work, I enjoy films, literature, running, and long conversations while walking. I like all forms of stories—one of the most remarkable human inventions.

## Research Focus
This line of work was developed during my PhD and investigates the structure of semantic knowledge and its variation across populations and historical periods. I combine methods involving:

- cross-linguistic semantic modeling  
- historical and contemporary corpora  
- neuroimaging data  
- cultural and ecological datasets  
- computational approaches to semantic structure  

This work aims to understand both universal constraints and context-dependent variations in meaning representation.

## Recent Work

### Semantic structure across languages
Cross-linguistic analyses of embeddings from 53 languages, semantic ratings across 8 languages, and fMRI data from 45 languages identify shared semantic dimensions and systematic ecological variation.

### Pathogens and semantic variation
Historical and cross-cultural analyses show that higher pathogen severity is associated with increased sensorimotor semantic dimensions in collective language use, both across countries and over the past century.

### Neural encoding of semantic relations
Using graph-based semantic models and fMRI, we show that distinct neural systems encode different structural properties of linguistic relations.
