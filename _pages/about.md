Hello! I am Ze Fu (付 泽). I am curious about how people make sense of the world using their internal mental models - the knowledge, beliefs and cultural products obtained through both biological and cultural evolution processes. To explore this, I combine insights and methods from different research fields like cognitive neuroscience, culture evolution, and human behavioral ecology. 

I am a PhD student in Cognitive Neuroscience working with [Dr. Yanchao Bi](https://bilab.bnu.edu.cn/people.html) at Beijing Normal University. My research compares how people represent meaning across different languages and historical periods, with a focus on how ecological and cultural factors shape these representations. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Psychology at Central China Normal University, where I developed my interest in Cognitive Science. Here is my [CV](/files/fuze_cv.pdf). 

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, reading books, running, and walking with friends. I'm fascinated by stories in all their forms - they're one of humanity's most beautiful inventions!

### What is the universal semantic structure in languages across the globe?

Recent advances in language models allow us to compare word meaning alignment across a large number of languages (Youn et al., 2016; Thompson et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2023) reviving the classic "universal vs culture-specific" debate, while different semantic representation assupmtions and methodologies may result different conclusions. Combined with evidences from mulptile approaches (53 languages' word embedding computation with model comparisons; 253 subjects, 8 languages' rating validation; 86 subjects, 45 languages' fMRI activity validation), we proposed a framework to understand cross-language meaning representation: the universal constrains rise from the intrinsic way in which the human brain represents semantic knowledge (13-neurocognitive salient dimensions) and variations from nature environments (e.g., climate).

### How 'sensorimotor' language evolve in history text?

A salient component in human semantic space is sensorimotor information carried by words/concepts. From an embodiment view, such information is highly grounded in human interaction with environments, while the exact mechanism remains elusive. Using a series large-scale text analyses across space (over 43 countries) and space (over the past 100 years), we found that the intensity of sensorimotor information in the collective semantic space (revealed by language) significantly modulated by the intensity of infectious diseases. These language changes may reflect shifts in cognitive patterns that drive cultural evolution.

### How language-derived semantic relations represented in the brain?

The human language system excels at extracting abstract relations from natural language expressions. In this project, we investigated how these relations contribute to neural semantic representations in the brain. We analyzed different types of relations computed from the Google n-gram corpus that language systems might be sensitive to, based on graph learning literature (first-order co-occurrence, secondary common neighbor relations, and shortest path). We found that different subsystems in the language network are sensitive to specific relations: the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) captures graph-common-neighbors, while the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior middle/inferior temporal gyrus (pMTG) capture graph-shortest-path relationships. Similar structural relations computed from a visual scene database (VisualGenome) were found in the human scene area, highlighting how semantic representations in the human brain are specific to both information type and statistical properties.
