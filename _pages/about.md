I am Ze Fu (付泽). My work examines how humans represent meaning and how semantic structures vary across languages, cultures, and ecological environments. I study semantic representation using approaches drawn from cognitive neuroscience, cultural evolution, and large-scale language analysis.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Institut Jean Nicod, École Normale Supérieure – PSL (Paris), working with Nicolas Baumard. I completed my Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience at Beijing Normal University, advised by Yanchao Bi, and previously studied at the University of California, Berkeley.

Outside work, I enjoy films, literature, running, and long conversations while walking.

## Research Focus
My research investigates the structure of semantic knowledge and its variation across populations and historical periods. I combine:

- cross-linguistic semantic modeling  
- large-scale historical corpora  
- neuroimaging data  
- cultural and ecological datasets  
- computational methods for semantic structure  

This work aims to understand both universal constraints and context-dependent variations in semantic representation.

# Recent Work

## Semantic structure across languages
Cross-linguistic analyses of embeddings from 53 languages, semantic ratings across 8 languages, and fMRI data from 45 languages reveal a set of shared semantic dimensions and systematic ecological variation.

## Pathogens and semantic variation
Historical and cross-cultural analyses show that higher pathogen severity is associated with increased sensorimotor semantic dimensions in collective language use across countries and over the past century.

## Neural encoding of semantic relations
Using graph-based semantic models and fMRI, we show that distinct neural systems encode different structural properties of semantic relations derived from language statistics.
